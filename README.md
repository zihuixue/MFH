## Synthetic Gaussian
Go to directory `gauss`

(1) Use synthetic Gaussian data to gain intuition about MFH

[Figure 2 and 3 in the paper] Generate multimodal data (data generation inspired from [here](https://github.com/lopezpaz/distillation_privileged_information.git)), and apply cross-modal KD.


```shell
python main.py
```
Experiment 1: vary γ

Experiment 2: vary α

<img src="gauss/figs/exp2.png" alt="image" width="70%">

(2) Verify the implications of MFH
```shell
python main_modify_gamma.py
```

[Table 2 in the paper] Modify γ in data, and observe the performance differences of cross-modal KD.

<img src="gauss/figs/table2.png" alt="image" width="70%" style="text-align: left;">

Three modes: (a) baseline-randomly keep some feature channels in x<sub>1</sub>; 
(b) if the ground truth data generation way is known, only keep "modality-general decisive" features channels in x<sub>1</sub>;
(c) if the data generation process is unknown, use Algorithm 1 to rank features based on "modality-general decisive" information.

Modifying data results in different γ, we then re-apply cross-modal KD to observe the performance differences. 
For mode (b) and (c), we observe that: although teacher performance downgrades significantly, student performance does not get affected. 
This helps verify the MFH implication and our proposed Alg. 1 as well.

## RAVDESS Emotion Recognition

Go to directory `ravdess`

Dataset: [The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.YG6fBy8RrUo). 

Teacher modality: audio; Student modality: images.

We provide the data splits and pre-processed features [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1alZF_3UZtcmxa8yzTaKz7k3lxdOJykPn?usp=sharing). Save the folder as `ravdess/data`.

(1) [optional] use Algorithm 1 to calculate the salience of modality-general decisive information for each feature channel
```bash
python main_overlap_tag.py --place 5 --num-permute 10 --first_time --cal_tag
```
`--place` controls at which layer we input multimodal features to the algorithm. The default choice is 5, which corresponds to a feature dimension of 128.  
`--num-permute` controls the number of permutations, which corresponds to M in Algorithm 1.  
`--first-time` will first train the unimodal networks (i.e., step 1 in Algorithm 1).  

After training, the teacher checkpoint (`teacher_mod_1_overlap.pkl`) and saliency vector (`overlap_tag_teacher_place{place}_repeat{num_permute}.npy`) will be generated under the `./results` directory.  

In addition, we provide the results directory [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1739ua67F650D7Ei7f9WZ57l1adLkZgOV?usp=share_link). Save the folder as `ravdess/results` and skip this step.

Visualize the saliency vector.
```bash
python utils/helper.py
```
<img src="ravdess/figs/saliency_vector.png" alt="image" width="40%">

The saliency vector is normalized to be [0, 1]; a larger value indicates a more salient feature channel (i.e., this channel contains more modality-general decisive information).

(2) Verify MFH using the calculated saliency vector.
```bash
# Mode 0 - randomly remove 75% feature channels
python main_overlap_tag.py --ratio 0.75 --mode 0 --eval_tag

# Mode 1 - Modality-general KD: remove the top %r feature channels that have the least modality-general decisive info
python main_overlap_tag.py --ratio 0.75 --mode 1 --eval_tag

# Mode 2 - Modality-specific KD: remove the top %r feature channels that have the most modality-general decisive info
python main_overlap_tag.py --ratio 0.75 --mode 2 --eval_tag
```
The expectation is that modality-general KD (mode 1) will yield the best student network.
